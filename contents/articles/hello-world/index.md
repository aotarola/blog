First of all, let me tell you who I am; my name is Andrés Otárola, from Chile, I'm a Software Developer with 6+ years of experience, and I work @ [Groupon][1].

Well to be honest, I gave you my name, told you my nationality, job title, and where I'm working on right now, but none of those things tells who I really am, doesn't it?

##So why create a blog, don't you have nothing better to do?

That in fact is an excellent question (kinda rude, but its ok), first of all I want to write about tech and life and whatever crosses my mind, second, I've been working a lot with NodeJS and it makes me really happy to write in a static blog engine written in NodeJS. Also I want to check-in my activities somewhere (so I can check them back in the future), so why not in a public blog? hosted in my favorite service -> [Github][2].

Well, I think that's it for today.

Cheers~~
